Some little helps for some of the tricky parts of the introductory questions for picoCTF 2019

## Taking hints
There are hints on the picoCTF website. They range from unhelpful to vaguely helpful -- but this is more due to the competitive nature of picoCTF for the first couple weeks after it is launched. For this class, I've provided deeper hints, but to prevent from people unintentionally seeing them (as much as possible) each hint is in a password protected zip file. just run `unzip [hint-file.zip]` and enter the password `hintplease!` to gain access to the hint.

## Other helpers
If you want, you can view some walkthroughs on YouTube by my predecessor, Prof. Martin Carlisle.

## Good luck!
As always ask questions of each other, and of your teachers!
